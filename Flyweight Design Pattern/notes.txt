Flyweight Design Pattern

Definition
    It's one of the structural design Pattern
    This pattern helps to reduce the memory usage by sharing data among multiple objects

Observe and Understand where to use this pattern:
    - when memory is limited
    - when objects shared data
        o intrinsic data: shared among objects and remian same once defined one value
        o Extrinsic data: Changes based on client input and differes from one object to another
    - creation of object is expensive

This is how it solves issue:
    - From object, remove all the Extrinsic data  and keep intrinsic data (this object is called flyweight object)
    - this flyweight class can be immutable
    - Extrinsic data can be passed to the flyweight class in method parameter
    - once the flyweight object is created, it is cached and reused whenever required
